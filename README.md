This is a repo of AngelHack's March Hackathon to create art with code.
My submission is an image with Letter A for Angelhack and with a basic representation of the Kenyan Flag.
Being new to the world of creating art with code, I thought using it to represent my country and the AngelHack community would be a great idea.
I only used python and its PIL library (Python Image Library) in this demo project.
